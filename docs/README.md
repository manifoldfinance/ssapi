The SushiLayer API is a set of **authenticated** endpoints used by market aggregators (e.g. coinmarketcap.com) to surface 
SushiSwap liquidity and volume information. All information is fetched from the underlying subgraphs.

## V2 Documentation

The documentation of the `/v2/` endpoints is [here](./v2.md).

## Deploying the API

The API uses the [serverless framework](https://serverless.com) and can easily be deployed to any AWS account,
via the `yarn sls deploy` command.

In order to configure your AWS account as a target, 
see [the serverless docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/).
